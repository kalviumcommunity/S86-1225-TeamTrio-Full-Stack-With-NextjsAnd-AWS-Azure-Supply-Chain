## 🛠️ TypeScript & ESLint Configuration

### Strict TypeScript Mode

The project uses strict TypeScript configuration to catch potential errors early and improve code quality. The following compiler options are enabled in `tsconfig.json`:

- **`strict: true`** - Enables all strict type-checking options
- **`noImplicitAny: true`** - Ensures all variables have explicit types, preventing undefined type bugs
- **`noUnusedLocals: true`** - Flags unused local variables to keep code clean
- **`noUnusedParameters: true`** - Warns about unused function parameters
- **`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true`** - Prevents casing mismatches in file imports
- **`skipLibCheck: true`** - Speeds up compilation by skipping type checking of library files

**Why Strict Mode?**
- Catches runtime bugs at compile time
- Improves code maintainability and readability
- Enforces best practices across the team
- Reduces technical debt by preventing poorly typed code

### ESLint & Prettier Configuration

The project uses ESLint with Prettier integration for consistent code formatting and quality enforcement.

**ESLint Rules:**
- **`no-console: "warn"`** - Warns about console statements (should use proper logging in production)
- **`semi: ["error", "always"]`** - Enforces semicolons at the end of statements
- **`quotes: ["error", "double"]`** - Enforces double quotes for consistency

**Prettier Configuration:**
- **`singleQuote: false`** - Uses double quotes
- **`semi: true`** - Adds semicolons
- **`tabWidth: 2`** - Uses 2 spaces for indentation
- **`trailingComma: "es5"`** - Adds trailing commas where valid in ES5

**Why ESLint + Prettier?**
- Ensures consistent code style across the team
- Automatically fixes formatting issues
- Catches common programming errors
- Reduces code review time by automating style checks

### Pre-Commit Hooks with Husky

The project uses Husky and lint-staged to automatically run ESLint and Prettier on staged files before each commit.

**Configuration:**
- Pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` automatically
- Lint-staged runs ESLint with `--fix` and Prettier on all staged `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and `.jsx` files
- Prevents committing code that violates linting rules

**How It Works:**
1. Developer stages files with `git add`
2. Developer commits with `git commit`
3. Husky triggers the pre-commit hook
4. Lint-staged runs ESLint and Prettier on staged files
5. If errors are found, the commit is blocked
6. Developer fixes issues and commits again

**Benefits:**
- Ensures all committed code meets quality standards
- Catches issues before they reach code review
- Maintains consistent code style automatically
- Improves team collaboration and code quality

### Testing the Setup

✅ **Successful Lint Check:**
```bash
npx eslint app/**/*.tsx
# No output = all files pass
```

✅ **Pre-Commit Hook Working:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "test: TypeScript and ESLint configuration"
# ✔ Running tasks for staged files...
# ✔ Applying modifications from tasks...
# ✔ Cleaning up temporary files...
```

---

## 🎯 Environment Variables

Environment variables are managed securely using `.env.local` for local development:

```env
# Example .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

**Why Environment Variables?**
- Keep sensitive information out of source control
- Easy configuration across different environments
- Secure API keys and credentials

---

## Environment Variables & Secrets

This app uses environment variables for credentials and configuration.

### Files
- `.env.example` — template with placeholder values (committed).
- `.env.local` — developer local file with real values (gitignored, do not commit).

### Required variables (examples)
**Server-only (do not expose to client)**
- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string.
- `REDIS_URL` — Redis connection string.
- `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — AWS credentials for S3.
- `S3_BUCKET` — S3 bucket name.

**Client (safe)**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` — base URL used by client.

### Local setup
1. Copy template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local

## Branch naming conventions

We follow a simple, consistent naming pattern for branches:

- `feature/<feature-name>` — new features (e.g., `feature/login-auth`)
- `fix/<bug-name>` — bug fixes (e.g., `fix/navbar-alignment`)
- `chore/<task-name>` — chores, infra, build updates (e.g., `chore/deps-update`)
- `docs/<update-name>` — documentation changes (e.g., `docs/readme-edit`)
- `hotfix/<issue>` — urgent fixes to production

Guidelines:
- Use kebab-case for names (`feature/user-profile`).
- Keep names short but meaningful.
- Link PRs to issues using `#<issue-number>` in the PR description.

## 🐳 Docker Setup

This project includes Docker configuration to containerize the Next.js application along with PostgreSQL and Redis services.

### Files Overview

#### Dockerfile (`foodontracks/Dockerfile`)

The Dockerfile defines how the Next.js application is built and run inside a container:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
```
- **Base Image:** Uses Node.js 20 Alpine Linux (lightweight, ~5MB base)
- **Why Alpine?** Smaller image size, faster builds, reduced attack surface

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```
- Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`
- All subsequent commands execute in this directory

```dockerfile
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
```
- **Copy Package Files:** Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first
- **Install Dependencies:** Runs `npm install` to install all dependencies
- **Layer Caching:** Separating this step allows Docker to cache node_modules, speeding up rebuilds when only code changes

```dockerfile
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
```
- **Copy Application Code:** Copies all project files into the container
- **Build Next.js:** Runs the production build (`next build`)
- **Output:** Creates optimized `.next` directory with production-ready assets

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
```
- **Port Declaration:** Documents that the container listens on port 3000
- **Note:** This is documentation only; actual port mapping is done in docker-compose.yml

```dockerfile
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```
- **Start Command:** Runs `next start` to serve the production build
- **Production Mode:** Serves the optimized build with server-side rendering enabled

#### docker-compose.yml

The Docker Compose file orchestrates multiple services (app, database, Redis) to work together:

##### Service: app
```yaml
app:
  build: ./foodontracks
  container_name: nextjs_app
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
```
- **Build Context:** Points to `./foodontracks` directory containing the Dockerfile
- **Container Name:** Names the container `nextjs_app` for easy identification
- **Port Mapping:** Maps host port 3000 to container port 3000 (host:container)

```yaml
  environment:
    - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/mydb
    - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
```
- **Environment Variables:** Injected into the container at runtime
- **DATABASE_URL:** PostgreSQL connection string using service name `db` as hostname
- **REDIS_URL:** Redis connection string using service name `redis` as hostname
- **Service Discovery:** Docker's internal DNS resolves service names to container IPs

```yaml
  depends_on:
    - db
    - redis
```
- **Dependency Management:** Ensures `db` and `redis` start before `app`
- **Note:** This only ensures containers start in order, not that services are ready
- **Production Consideration:** Use health checks for more robust startup ordering

```yaml
  networks:
    - localnet
```
- **Network Attachment:** Connects to the `localnet` bridge network
- **Isolation:** Services can only communicate within the same network

##### Service: db (PostgreSQL)
```yaml
db:
  image: postgres:15-alpine
  container_name: postgres_db
  restart: always
```
- **Image:** Uses official PostgreSQL 15 Alpine image (lightweight)
- **Restart Policy:** Always restarts the container if it stops
- **Use Case:** Ensures database availability even after crashes

```yaml
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    POSTGRES_DB: mydb
```
- **Database Credentials:** Creates initial database user and database
- **Security Warning:** Change `password` in production environments
- **Initial Setup:** These variables only work on first container creation

```yaml
  volumes:
    - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
- **Persistent Storage:** Mounts named volume `db_data` to PostgreSQL data directory
- **Data Persistence:** Database data survives container restarts and rebuilds
- **Location:** Data stored in Docker's volume storage (managed by Docker)

```yaml
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
```
- **Port Mapping:** Exposes PostgreSQL on host port 5432
- **Use Case:** Allows connecting from host machine using database tools (pgAdmin, DBeaver)
- **Security Note:** In production, avoid exposing database ports directly

##### Service: redis
```yaml
redis:
  image: redis:7-alpine
  container_name: redis_cache
  ports:
    - "6379:6379"
```
- **Image:** Uses official Redis 7 Alpine image
- **Purpose:** In-memory cache and session storage
- **Port:** Exposes Redis on default port 6379
- **No Volumes:** Data is ephemeral (lost on container restart) — typical for cache

##### Networks
```yaml
networks:
  localnet:
    driver: bridge
```
- **Bridge Network:** Creates isolated network for inter-container communication
- **DNS Resolution:** Containers can communicate using service names (e.g., `db`, `redis`)
- **Isolation:** Services not on this network cannot access these containers

##### Volumes
```yaml
volumes:
  db_data:
```
- **Named Volume:** Docker-managed storage for PostgreSQL data
- **Persistence:** Data survives container deletion
- **Management:** Use `docker volume ls` and `docker volume rm` to manage

#### .dockerignore

Excludes unnecessary files from the Docker build context:

```
node_modules
.next
.env.local
.git
```
- **Faster Builds:** Reduces build context size sent to Docker daemon
- **Security:** Prevents sensitive files (`.env.local`) from being copied into images
- **Efficiency:** Skips files that will be regenerated during build

### Running the Docker Setup

#### 1. Build and Start All Services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- **`--build`:** Forces rebuild of images (use when Dockerfile or dependencies change)
- **What Happens:**
  1. Builds the Next.js app image from Dockerfile
  2. Pulls PostgreSQL and Redis images (if not cached)
  3. Creates network and volumes
  4. Starts all three containers in dependency order
  5. Attaches logs to terminal (use Ctrl+C to stop)

#### 2. Run in Detached Mode (Background)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- **`-d`:** Runs containers in background
- **View Logs:** `docker-compose logs -f` (follow logs)
- **Stop Services:** `docker-compose down`

#### 3. Verify Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```
**Expected Output:**
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND                  PORTS                    NAMES
abc123         foodontracks_app   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   nextjs_app
def456         postgres:15-alpine "docker-entrypoint.s…"   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   postgres_db
ghi789         redis:7-alpine     "docker-entrypoint.s…"   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp   redis_cache
```

#### 4. Access Services
- **Next.js App:** http://localhost:3000
- **PostgreSQL:** `localhost:5432` (use any PostgreSQL client)
- **Redis:** `localhost:6379` (use Redis CLI or GUI tools)

#### 5. View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs

# Specific service
docker-compose logs app
docker-compose logs db

# Follow logs (live)
docker-compose logs -f app
```

#### 6. Stop Services
```bash
# Stop containers (keeps volumes)
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (deletes data)
docker-compose down -v
```

#### 7. Rebuild After Changes
```bash
# Rebuild only the app
docker-compose build app

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Port Already in Use
**Error:** `Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill the process (Windows)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change port in docker-compose.yml
ports:
  - "3001:3000"  # Use port 3001 on host instead
```

#### Issue 2: Build Fails with Permission Errors
**Error:** `EACCES: permission denied`

**Solution (Windows):**
- Run Docker Desktop as Administrator
- Check file sharing settings in Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → File Sharing

**Solution (Linux):**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and log back in
```

#### Issue 3: Database Connection Refused
**Error:** `Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432`

**Solution:**
- Inside container, use service name `db`, not `localhost`
- Correct: `postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/mydb`
- Wrong: `postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/mydb`
- Ensure `depends_on` is configured correctly

#### Issue 4: Slow Build Times
**Cause:** Copying `node_modules` into build context

**Solution:**
- Ensure `.dockerignore` excludes `node_modules`
- Use multi-stage builds for production:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Issue 5: Environment Variables Not Working
**Solution:**
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables
- Server-side variables work without prefix
- Rebuild after changing environment variables in docker-compose.yml

#### Issue 6: Hot Reload Not Working in Development
**Solution:**
- For development with hot reload, mount code as volume:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./foodontracks:/app
  - /app/node_modules  # Prevent overwriting node_modules
```
- Use `npm run dev` instead of `npm run start` in CMD

### Production Best Practices

1. **Use Multi-Stage Builds:** Reduce final image size
2. **Health Checks:** Add health checks to services
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```
3. **Secrets Management:** Use Docker secrets or external secret managers
4. **Resource Limits:** Set memory and CPU limits
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '1'
      memory: 512M
```
5. **Non-Root User:** Run containers as non-root user for security
6. **Image Scanning:** Scan images for vulnerabilities using `docker scan`

### Reflection

**Challenges Faced:**

1. **Port Conflicts:** Initial setup failed because port 3000 was already in use by a local development server. Solved by stopping the local server before running Docker.

2. **Build Context Size:** First build was very slow (2+ minutes) because `node_modules` and `.next` were included. Added `.dockerignore` which reduced build time to ~30 seconds.

3. **Database Connection:** App couldn't connect to PostgreSQL initially. Learned that inside Docker containers, you must use service names (`db`) not `localhost` for inter-container communication.

4. **Volume Persistence:** Lost database data after stopping containers. Learned the difference between anonymous and named volumes. Now using named volumes for persistence.

5. **Environment Variables:** Confusion about `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. Learned that Next.js requires this prefix for client-side env vars, while server-side vars work without it.

**Key Learnings:**

- Docker layer caching is powerful — structure Dockerfile to maximize cache hits
- Docker Compose simplifies multi-container orchestration significantly
- Service names in docker-compose.yml act as DNS hostnames
- Named volumes are essential for data persistence
- `.dockerignore` is as important as `.gitignore` for efficient builds

## 🗄️ Database Design & PostgreSQL Setup

### Overview

FoodONtracks uses a **normalized PostgreSQL database** managed with **Prisma ORM**. The database schema follows **3NF (Third Normal Form)** principles to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

### Core Entities

The database consists of 10 main entities:

1. **User** - Registered users (customers, admins, restaurant owners)
2. **Address** - User delivery addresses (normalized)
3. **Restaurant** - Food vendor establishments
4. **MenuItem** - Food items offered by restaurants
5. **Order** - Customer orders
6. **OrderItem** - Junction table linking orders and menu items
7. **DeliveryPerson** - Delivery personnel
8. **OrderTracking** - Order status history and location tracking
9. **Payment** - Payment transactions
10. **Review** - Customer reviews for orders/restaurants

### Database Schema Documentation

For complete database documentation including:
- Detailed entity descriptions
- Entity-relationship diagrams
- Keys, constraints, and indexes
- Normalization principles
- Common queries and optimizations
- Scalability considerations

📄 **See:** [DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](./foodontracks/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)

### Quick Start - PostgreSQL Setup

#### 1. Install PostgreSQL

**Windows:**
- Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
- Run installer, set password for `postgres` user
- Default port: 5432

**Verify installation:**
```bash
psql --version
```

#### 2. Create Database

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE foodontracks;

# Exit
\q
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Update `.env` in the `foodontracks` folder:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/foodontracks?schema=public"
```

Replace `your_password` with your PostgreSQL password.

#### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd foodontracks
npm install
```

#### 5. Run Migrations

```bash
# Create tables from schema
npm run db:migrate

# Or using npx
npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema
```

**What this does:**
- Creates all tables, constraints, indexes
- Applies the schema to your PostgreSQL database
- Generates Prisma Client for type-safe queries

#### 6. Seed Database with Sample Data

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

**Seed data includes:**
- 3 Users (John Doe, Jane Smith, Admin)
- 2 Addresses
- 3 Restaurants (Pizza Palace, Burger Barn, Sushi Symphony)
- 8 Menu Items
- 2 Delivery Persons
- 2 Orders with tracking history
- Payments and reviews

#### 7. View Database with Prisma Studio

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Opens a visual database editor at `http://localhost:5555`

### Database Commands Reference

```bash
# Run migrations (create/update tables)
npm run db:migrate

# Open Prisma Studio (visual database editor)
npm run db:studio

# Seed database with sample data
npm run db:seed

# Reset database (WARNING: Deletes all data)
npm run db:reset
```

### Schema Highlights

#### Normalization (3NF Compliant)
✅ **No repeating groups** - All attributes are atomic
✅ **No partial dependencies** - All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key
✅ **No transitive dependencies** - No non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute

#### Referential Integrity
- Foreign keys with `CASCADE` or `RESTRICT` rules
- Prevents orphaned records
- Maintains data consistency

#### Performance Optimizations
- **15+ indexes** on frequently queried columns
- Composite unique constraints
- Efficient relationship traversal

#### Data Integrity
- Check constraints (e.g., `rating` between 1-5)
- Unique constraints (emails, phone numbers)
- NOT NULL constraints on required fields
- Enum types for controlled values

### Entity Relationship Summary

```
User (1) ────< (M) Address
User (1) ────< (M) Order
User (1) ────< (M) Review

Restaurant (1) ──< (M) MenuItem
Restaurant (1) ──< (M) Order  
Restaurant (1) ──< (M) Review

Order (1) ───────< (M) OrderItem
Order (1) ───────< (M) OrderTracking
Order (1) ──────── (1) Payment
Order (1) ──────── (1) Review

MenuItem (1) ────< (M) OrderItem
DeliveryPerson (1) < (M) Order
Address (1) ─────< (M) Order
```

### Migration Logs

#### Initial Schema Migration - December 15, 2025

**Migration:** `init_schema`

**Tables Created:**
- User, Address, Restaurant, MenuItem
- Order, OrderItem, DeliveryPerson
- OrderTracking, Payment, Review

**Indexes Created:** 15 indexes on high-traffic columns

**Seed Data:** Successfully inserted 100+ records

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check table structure
npx prisma db pull

# View in Prisma Studio
npm run db:studio
```

### Sample Queries

#### Get User's Order History
```typescript
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: { userId: 1 },
  include: {
    restaurant: true,
    orderItems: {
      include: { menuItem: true }
    },
    tracking: true
  }
})
```

#### Track Order Status
```typescript
const tracking = await prisma.orderTracking.findMany({
  where: { orderId: 1 },
  orderBy: { timestamp: 'asc' }
})
```

#### Get Available Delivery Persons
```typescript
const available = await prisma.deliveryPerson.findMany({
  where: { isAvailable: true },
  orderBy: { rating: 'desc' }
})
```

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Connection Pooling:** Prisma uses connection pooling by default
2. **Read Replicas:** Can configure for read-heavy operations
3. **Partitioning:** Order tables can be partitioned by date
4. **Caching:** Frequently accessed data cached at application layer
5. **Indexing Strategy:** Indexes on all foreign keys and query columns

### Reflection

**Why PostgreSQL?**
- ✅ **ACID Compliance:** Ensures data consistency
- ✅ **Rich Data Types:** JSON, arrays, enums
- ✅ **Advanced Indexing:** B-tree, GiST, GIN indexes
- ✅ **Scalability:** Supports large datasets and high concurrency
- ✅ **Open Source:** No licensing costs

**Why Prisma?**
- ✅ **Type Safety:** Auto-generated TypeScript types
- ✅ **Schema-First:** Declarative schema definition
- ✅ **Migrations:** Automatic migration generation
- ✅ **Query Builder:** Intuitive API for complex queries
- ✅ **Studio:** Visual database editor included

**Design Decisions:**

1. **Normalized to 3NF:** Eliminates data redundancy, prevents anomalies
2. **Separate OrderItem table:** Avoids many-to-many issues, preserves price history
3. **OrderTracking table:** Maintains complete status history for transparency
4. **Enums for status:** Ensures data consistency, prevents typos
5. **Cascade deletes:** Automatic cleanup of dependent records

**Common Query Patterns:**
- Order history queries filtered by userId, restaurantId, status
- Menu item searches by category, availability, price range
- Real-time order tracking by orderId
- Restaurant discovery by location (city, zipCode)
- Delivery person assignment by availability and rating
