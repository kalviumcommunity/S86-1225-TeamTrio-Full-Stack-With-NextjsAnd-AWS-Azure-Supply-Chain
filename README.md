# 🚆 FoodONtracks — Digital Food Traceability System

FoodONtracks is a **Batch Number–based traceability platform** designed to improve food safety in Indian Railway catering.  
Each food batch receives a unique Batch ID, and suppliers, kitchens, vendors, and admins log every step — enabling transparent, trackable, and safe food handling.

## 🛠️ TypeScript & ESLint Configuration

### Strict TypeScript Mode

The project uses strict TypeScript configuration to catch potential errors early and improve code quality. The following compiler options are enabled in `tsconfig.json`:

- **`strict: true`** - Enables all strict type-checking options
- **`noImplicitAny: true`** - Ensures all variables have explicit types, preventing undefined type bugs
- **`noUnusedLocals: true`** - Flags unused local variables to keep code clean
- **`noUnusedParameters: true`** - Warns about unused function parameters
- **`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true`** - Prevents casing mismatches in file imports
- **`skipLibCheck: true`** - Speeds up compilation by skipping type checking of library files

**Why Strict Mode?**
- Catches runtime bugs at compile time
- Improves code maintainability and readability
- Enforces best practices across the team
- Reduces technical debt by preventing poorly typed code

### ESLint & Prettier Configuration

The project uses ESLint with Prettier integration for consistent code formatting and quality enforcement.

**ESLint Rules:**
- **`no-console: "warn"`** - Warns about console statements (should use proper logging in production)
- **`semi: ["error", "always"]`** - Enforces semicolons at the end of statements
- **`quotes: ["error", "double"]`** - Enforces double quotes for consistency

**Prettier Configuration:**
- **`singleQuote: false`** - Uses double quotes
- **`semi: true`** - Adds semicolons
- **`tabWidth: 2`** - Uses 2 spaces for indentation
- **`trailingComma: "es5"`** - Adds trailing commas where valid in ES5

**Why ESLint + Prettier?**
- Ensures consistent code style across the team
- Automatically fixes formatting issues
- Catches common programming errors
- Reduces code review time by automating style checks

### Pre-Commit Hooks with Husky

The project uses Husky and lint-staged to automatically run ESLint and Prettier on staged files before each commit.

**Configuration:**
- Pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` automatically
- Lint-staged runs ESLint with `--fix` and Prettier on all staged `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and `.jsx` files
- Prevents committing code that violates linting rules

**How It Works:**
1. Developer stages files with `git add`
2. Developer commits with `git commit`
3. Husky triggers the pre-commit hook
4. Lint-staged runs ESLint and Prettier on staged files
5. If errors are found, the commit is blocked
6. Developer fixes issues and commits again

**Benefits:**
- Ensures all committed code meets quality standards
- Catches issues before they reach code review
- Maintains consistent code style automatically
- Improves team collaboration and code quality

### Testing the Setup

✅ **Successful Lint Check:**
```bash
npx eslint app/**/*.tsx
# No output = all files pass
```

✅ **Pre-Commit Hook Working:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "test: TypeScript and ESLint configuration"
# ✔ Running tasks for staged files...
# ✔ Applying modifications from tasks...
# ✔ Cleaning up temporary files...
```

---

## 🎯 Environment Variables

Environment variables are managed securely using `.env.local` for local development:

```env
# Example .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

**Why Environment Variables?**
- Keep sensitive information out of source control
- Easy configuration across different environments
- Secure API keys and credentials
